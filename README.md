Working on Angela Yu's Udemy course.
There are a lot of changes that need to be made to update the course to the latest Swift 6.0.3 and Xcode 16.2.
One of the cool things about this course is that early on Angela gave us information on how to figure out what to do if we ran into an error.
That has been very helpful when trying to update the program exmples from Xcode 13 to 16.

In this module about git and github we are writing a story and using github as a place to backup our code.
